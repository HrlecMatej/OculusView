In the context of the diploma thesis we have visualized a virtual journey on a selected path with the use of web services for geolocation and a device for virtual reality with which to immerse in the three-dimensional world. The whole process is quite quick in order not to negatively influence the user's experience. The application is made in C# language and based on the .NET Framework. The data for maps and panoramic images has been obtained from services provided by Google. Its main functionalities are path selection on a map and a very fast playback of Google Street View panoramic pictures. In this way we achieve such an effect as if we recorded the selected route from the car. Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 was chosen for implementing virtual reality and in order to take full advantage of its capabilities it has been integrated into a WPF aplication.
